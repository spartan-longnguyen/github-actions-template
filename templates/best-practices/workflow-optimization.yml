# Workflow Optimization Patterns
#
# This workflow demonstrates various workflow optimization patterns.
# Key best practices shown:
# - Parallel job execution (lint and test run simultaneously)
# - Job dependencies (build waits for lint and test)
# - Artifact sharing between jobs
# - Concurrency control (cancel in-progress runs)
# - Conditional steps and jobs
#
# Usage: This workflow runs on push and can be triggered manually

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, master ]
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  contents: read
  actions: write # required for cache write and artifacts

concurrency:
  # KEY BEST PRACTICE: Concurrency control prevents multiple runs from interfering
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true # Cancel older runs when new one starts

jobs:
  # Example 1: Parallel jobs that run simultaneously
  lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '18'
          cache: 'yarn'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: yarn install --frozen-lockfile

      - name: Run linters
        run: |
          echo "Running linters..."
          yarn lint
          # Or: npm run lint

      - name: Upload lint results
        if: always()
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: lint-results
          path: lint-results/
          retention-days: 7

  # This job runs in parallel with 'lint' (not waiting for it)
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '18'
          cache: 'yarn'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: yarn install --frozen-lockfile

      - name: Run tests
        run: |
          echo "Running tests..."
          yarn test --coverage
          # Or: npm test

      - name: Upload test results
        if: always()

        with:
          name: test-results
          path: coverage/
          retention-days: 7

  # Example 2: Job dependencies - build waits for both lint and test
  build:
    # KEY BEST PRACTICE: Use 'needs' to define job dependencies
    needs: [ lint, test ]
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: yarn install --frozen-lockfile

      - name: Build application
        run: |
          echo "Building application..."
          yarn build
          # Or: npm run build

      # KEY BEST PRACTICE: Upload artifacts for use in other jobs
      - name: Upload build artifacts
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: dist
          path: dist/
          retention-days: 30

  # Example 3: Conditional job execution
  deploy-dev:
    needs: build
    # KEY BEST PRACTICE: Conditional job execution
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' || github.ref == 'refs/heads/master'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # KEY BEST PRACTICE: Download artifacts from previous job
      - name: Download build artifacts
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: dist

      - name: Deploy to DEV
        run: |
          echo "Deploying to DEV environment..."
          # In a real scenario, you would deploy here
          # e.g., upload to S3, deploy to ECS, etc.

  # Example 4: Conditional steps within a job
  deploy-prod:
    needs: build
    if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/v')
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Download build artifacts
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: dist

      # KEY BEST PRACTICE: Conditional step execution
      - name: Deploy to PROD
        if: github.event_name == 'push'
        run: |
          echo "Deploying to PROD environment..."
          # Only runs on push events, not manual triggers

      - name: Send notification
        if: always() # Runs even if previous step fails
        run: |
          echo "Deployment notification sent"

  # Example 5: Job status checking
  post-deploy:
    needs: [ deploy-dev, deploy-prod ]
    # KEY BEST PRACTICE: Check job status before proceeding
    if: |
      always() && 
      (needs.deploy-dev.result == 'success' || needs.deploy-prod.result == 'success')
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Post-deployment tasks
        run: |
          echo "Running post-deployment tasks..."
          # Only runs if at least one deployment succeeded

  # Example 6: Reusable workflow pattern (commented example)
  # This demonstrates how you could extract common patterns
  # into reusable workflows
  #
  # .github/workflows/deploy.yml (reusable workflow):
  # on:
  #   workflow_call:
  #     inputs:
  #       environment:
  #         required: true
  #         type: string
  #
  # jobs:
  #   deploy:
  #     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  #     steps:
  #       - name: Deploy to ${{ inputs.environment }}
  #         run: echo "Deploying to ${{ inputs.environment }}"
  #
  # Then call it from another workflow:
  # jobs:
  #   deploy-prod:
  #     uses: ./.github/workflows/deploy.yml
  #     with:
  #       environment: 'prod'
