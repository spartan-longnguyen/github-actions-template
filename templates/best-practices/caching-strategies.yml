# Caching Strategies
#
# This workflow demonstrates various caching patterns for GitHub Actions.
# Key best practices shown:
# - Built-in caching for Node.js, Python, and Java/Gradle
# - Manual caching with actions/cache@v4 for custom paths
# - Cache key strategies (hash-based, branch-based, SHA-based)
# - Restore keys for partial cache matches
# - Cache scope control (read-only for PRs)
#
# Usage: This workflow can be triggered manually to demonstrate caching

  # Example 1: Built-in caching for Node.js/Yarn
  cache-nodejs:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code

      # KEY BEST PRACTICE: Built-in caching automatically handles yarn cache
      - name: Set up Node.js with automatic yarn caching
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4

        # On first run, this downloads dependencies
        # On subsequent runs, this restores from cache (much faster!)
